Can be used for a variety of purposes. Although hard money loans are often used in real estate projects, like fix and flip loans, they can serve different short-term purposes. You can use a hard money loan for working capital, debt refinancing or consolidation, as well as bridge financing.

Fast access to funds. Some hard money lenders may be able to approve your application within 24 hours and provide funding in as little as one to two business days. Traditional bank loans, on the other hand, can take several weeks or even months to qualify. Banks also tend to require document-heavy applications and may require you to apply in person. Many hard money lenders offer streamlined, online applications with minimal documentation.

Easy to qualify. Hard money business loan requirements are largely based on the value of your collateral. Although lenders may look at your credit score, time in business and business finances, they donâ€™t typically weigh these factors as heavily when underwriting your application. Businesses with bad credit and startups, therefore, may be able to qualify for hard money loans.
